Hi, This is my Rock Paper Scissor game

This Python program is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game that allows the player to compete against the computer. The game consists of 10 rounds, and the player earns points based on the outcome of each round.

At the beginning of the game, the program explains the rules and prompts the player to choose between rock (r), paper (p), or scissors (s). The computer randomly selects its choice, and the two choices are compared to determine the winner of each round.

The program uses conditional statements to compare the player's choice with the computer's choice and determines the winner accordingly. If the choices are the same, it's a tie and no points are awarded. If the player wins, they earn one point, and if the computer wins, it earns one point. The program keeps track of the player's points and the computer's points throughout the game.

After 10 rounds, the program announces the end of the game and displays the final scores. If the computer has more points, it declares the computer as the winner. If the player has more points, it declares the player as the winner. If both have the same number of points, it declares a tie.

In summary, this Python program allows players to enjoy a basic Rock Paper Scissors game against the computer. The program keeps track of scores, determines the winner, and provides an interactive experience for the players.
